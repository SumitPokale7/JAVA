// 1. Single Inheritence :- One Class Extends Another Class
// 2. Multiple Inheritence :- One Class Extends More than One Class
// 3. Hiearchial Inheritence :- One Class is Inherited by Many Classes
// 4. Hybrid Inheritence :- Combination of Single And Multiple Inheritence

// Ex. Multiple :-
// Class A And Class B Inherited by Class C
// Both the Classes Have n = 5 & n = 10
// Which one Will be Called When Object of class C is Created?
// It will be Ambigous for Compiler for to chose one
// So that's why Java Doesn't not Support Multiple Inheritence
